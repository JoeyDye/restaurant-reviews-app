# Restaurant Reviews App

The restaurant review app displays a selection of handpicked local restaurants for food lovers of all types.

Features include images, map and directions, hours of operation, reviews, and more for each chosen location.

The app is responsive, accessible, and even offers some offline functionality.

## Getting Started

Install this app by either downloading the zip file or cloning the repository to your local computer.

The repo includes the HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, and image files needed to run the app. You will need to use your own Google Maps API key. You will need to run a simple HTTP server on your computer to serve up the site on your local computer.

## Deployment

The project includes a simple build process that can be run using the `gulp` command.

Once the project has been built, you can run the project on your local computer using a simple HTTP server.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
